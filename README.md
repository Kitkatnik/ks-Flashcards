### 🧠 What I learned

This was an assessment for Thinkful's Software Engineering Immersion.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Installing packages via NPM
- Running tests from the command line
- Writing React function components
- Creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router
- Using hooks like useState(), useParams(), and useHistory()
- Debugging React code through console output and using the VS Code debugger

**Grading Criteria:**

- All the props are treated as read-only.
- State is never directly mutated; it's only updated via setState().
- The Edit Card and Create Card screens share the same form component.
- The useEffect() hooks have the appropriate dependencies listed in the dependency array.
- State is "lifted up" to the parent component where appropriate.
- All inputs are controlled. Generally, there is a warning on the console when you type into the input box and it changes from uncontrolled to controlled. The warning looks like this: "Warning: Input is changing an uncontrolled input of type <text|number|etc.> to be controlled." This is often the result of initializing the state to null or undefined.
